STUDENT ARTS GROUPS
cfa.nus.edu.sg
Participation in the arts encourages 
creativity to flourish and positively 
enhances students’ development and 
academic outcomes. The NUS Centre 
For the Arts (CFA) inspires students to 
unleash their passion through the arts 
– visual arts, dance, music and theatre. 
Augment your studies by getting involved 
with one of NUS’ Arts Excellence Groups. 
These groups, supported by CFA and 
tutored by dedicated industry artistes,  
cover traditional Asian dances to the 
latest in hip-hop, and from classical 
symphonies to avant-garde electronic 
music. 
NUS unveiled its very own University 
Cultural Centre (UCC) in 2000. Besides 
hosting the annual NUS commencement 
ceremonies, the UCC is a popular venue 
for various performances by students and 
staff, Singaporean arts companies and 
international artistes, and state events.
