Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.
Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omnichannel strategy. Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other 
facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are leased under multi-year contracts. As such, it is essential 
that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example:
• 
changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omnichannel environment;
• 
our ability to adjust store operating models to adapt to these changing patterns;
• 
the location and appropriate number of stores, supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio;
• 
the interior layout, format and size of our stores;
• 
the products and services we offer at each store;
• 
the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;
• 
the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store; and
• 
the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents.
If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms, or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:
• 
closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;
• 
incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;
• 
operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and
• 
bearing excessive lease expenses.
These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.
For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local 
real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to 
influence some of these factors, and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are typically still responsible for taxes, insurance and 
common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a 
tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the 
sub-lease tenant.
Operational Risks
Interruptions and other factors affecting our stores and supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our 
business.
Our stores and supply chain assets are a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the 
emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors’ abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, at the right time and in the 
right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these 
aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to:
• 
interruptions to our delivery capabilities;
• 
failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;
• 
disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;
• 
limitations in capacity;
• 
global supply chain impacts that could hinder our vendors’ ability to meet our demand for product volumes and timing;
• 
increased levels of inventory loss due to organized crime, theft or damage;
• 
risk to our employees and customers arising from burglary or robbery from our stores or other facilities;
• 
consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;
• 
labor strikes, slow-downs or labor shortages, including as a result of an increasingly competitive job market, affecting our stores or impacting ports or 
any other aspect of our supply chain;
• 
diseases, pandemics (including COVID-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns; and
• 
increasing transportation costs.
It is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. Any disruption to, or 
inefficiency in, our supply chain network, whether due to geopolitical conflicts, the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, could damage our revenue and 
profitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of 
carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. If we 
fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability.
