CAMPUSES
KENT RIDGE CAMPUS 
NUS’ main campus since 1980, 
the sprawling 150-hectare Kent Ridge 
Campus hosts most of the University’s 
academic, research and administrative 
facilities. It is also a bustling hub of 
student life, with student residences, 
sports facilities and venues for arts 
and cultural activities. 
OUTRAM CAMPUS 
Located among many of the 
nation’s key medical institutions, 
the Outram Campus houses the 
Duke-NUS Medical School 
(Duke-NUS). Duke-NUS’ 
innovative medical education 
programme with a distinctive 
research focus is designed to 
develop medical leaders in 
research, education and 
patient care.

The Bukit Timah Campus houses 
the Faculty of Law and the
