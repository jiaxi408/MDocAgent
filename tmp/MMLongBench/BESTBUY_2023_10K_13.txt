We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationships or their services may have an 
adverse impact on our business.
We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, delivery and installation, customer 
warranty, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift 
cards, technical support, transportation, insurance programs and human resource operations. Any material disruption in our relationships with key third-party 
business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our 
operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods.
Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results.
Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Best Buy Essentials, Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, as well as 
products such as Jitterbug and Lively branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. Most of 
these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers in China and Southeast Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, 
which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results:
• 
we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brands product defects, and 
our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;
• 
we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive 
brands products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;
• 
we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may 
experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term 
relationships with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics, unforeseen natural disasters or geopolitical crises, such as the conflict in Ukraine 
and this conflict’s potential impact on global geopolitical tensions, including with China or between China and Taiwan;
• 
we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brands products or for migration of the 
manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;
• 
we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return-to-vendor rights;
• 
we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacturing of products in foreign countries, and we may be 
unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;
• 
we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual 
property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brands products;
• 
our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with 
China, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply; and
• 
we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brands products or manufacturing 
processes.
Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate 
revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brands products 
and the profits we are able to generate from them.
We are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the U.S.
Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, 
especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, 
merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, 
inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics (including COVID-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors 
may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities 
or change their pricing policies. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a 
material adverse impact on our business.
The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. We 
rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain 
management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment (including, for example, our Urgent Response service provided by Best Buy Health), staff planning and 
deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information.
