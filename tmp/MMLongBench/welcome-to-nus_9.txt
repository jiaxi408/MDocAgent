COMMUNITY SERVICE CLUB
NUSSU traces its roots to its early 
predecessor, the University of 
Malaya Students’ Union (UMSU), 
which was established in 1949. 
UMSU then evolved into the 
University of Singapore Students’ 
Union (USSU), and took its 
present form as NUSSU in 1980, 
following the inception of NUS.
Generations of NUSSU executive 
committee members and 
volunteers gathered at the NUSS 
Kent Ridge Guild House on 
23 August 2019 to reconnect 
with old friends and celebrate 
the Union’s 70th anniversary.
