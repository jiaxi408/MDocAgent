Backgroundtothisinspection
We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the
Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our regulatory
functions. This inspection was planned to check whether
the provider is meeting the legal requirements and
regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act
2008, to look at the overall quality of the service, and to
provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.
This inspection took place on 7 and 10 July 2015 and was
unannounced. The inspection was carried out by two
inspectors and an expert by experience in the care of the
elderly. An expert by experience is a person who has
personal experience of using or caring for someone who
uses this type of care service.
We reviewed the information we held about the service
including notifications. A notification is information about
important events which the service is required to send us
by law.
We spoke with 20 of the 28 people living in the home and
six relatives. We also spoke with the registered manager,
deputy manager, the administrator, seven care staff, a cook,
and a maintenance staff. We spoke with two health
professionals. We observed staff providing care and
support to people in the lounges, and during the lunchtime
meal in the dining room. We looked at care plans and
associated records for eight people living in the home. We
checked staff duty records, two recruitment files, records of
complaints and accidents and incidents, medicine
administration records, staff and residents’ meeting
minutes, quality assurance records and some of the
provider’s policies, procedures.
