Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically, and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. 
Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the retail and consumer 
electronics industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. If changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other 
things, interest costs for certain of our credit facilities, our future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, vendor financing terms and future new-store leasing 
costs.
Restricted Cash
Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are primarily restricted to cover product protection plans provided under our Best Buy Totaltech 
membership offering and other self-insurance liabilities. Restricted cash, which is included in Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, was 
$379 million and $269 million as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. The increase in restricted cash was primarily due to our Best Buy 
Totaltech membership offering and growth in the membership base, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash for other self-insurance liabilities.

Total capital expenditures exclude non-cash capital expenditures of $35 million, $46 million and $32 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Non-cash capital expenditures are 
comprised of additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable, as well as finance leases.
We currently expect capital expenditures to approximate $850 million in fiscal 2024. 
Debt and Capital
As of January 28, 2023, we had $500 million of principal amount of notes due October 1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”) and $650 million of principal amount of notes due 
October 1, 2030 (“2030 Notes”). Refer to Note 8, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our outstanding debt.
Share Repurchases and Dividends
We repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our Board. The payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary 
legal and contractual restrictions. Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over 
time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. Our share repurchase plans are evaluated on 
an ongoing basis, considering factors such as our financial condition and cash flows, our economic outlook, the impact of tax laws, our liquidity needs, and the 
health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on such factors.
On February 28, 2022, our Board approved a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program, which replaced the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized 
on February 16, 2021. There is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization.
