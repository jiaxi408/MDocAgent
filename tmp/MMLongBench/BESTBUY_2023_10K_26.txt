The decrease in revenue in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by lower sales in Canada due to comparable sales declines across most of our product categories 
and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.

Notable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:
• 
Computing and Mobile Phones: The 6.1% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing and tablets, partially offset by comparable 
sales growth in mobile phones.
• 
Consumer Electronics: The 6.2% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater and health and fitness.
• 
Appliances: The 0.3% comparable sales growth was driven by small appliances.
• 
Entertainment: The 8.6% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by gaming and virtual reality.
•

Our gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by lower product margin rates and higher supply chain costs in Canada.
Our SG&A decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates. 
The restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2023 primarily related to employee termination benefits related to an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that 
commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as optimize our cost structure. Refer 
to Note 3, Restructuring, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Our operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the unfavorable gross profit rate described above and decreased leverage from lower 
sales volume on our fixed expenses, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate.
