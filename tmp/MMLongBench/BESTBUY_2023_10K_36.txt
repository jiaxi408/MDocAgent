How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to evaluating whether the vendor allowances were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements and the 
completeness and accuracy of deferred vendor allowances included the following, among others: 

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the recording of vendor allowances, including management's controls over the establishment of vendor 
arrangements, the calculation of vendor allowances earned, and the determination of the deferred vendor allowances recorded as a reduction to inventory.

We selected a sample of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of cost of sales and (1) recalculated the amount recognized using the terms of the 
vendor agreement; (2) for certain arrangements, confirmed the terms of the agreement directly with the vendor; and (3) evaluated, based on the terms of the 
agreement, if the amount should be deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventory.

Where confirmation responses from vendors were not received, we completed alternative procedures such as agreement to underlying contractual 
arrangements, tested the settlement of the arrangement and held discussions with a sample of Company buyers to understand the terms of the agreement.

We tested the amount of deferred vendor allowances recorded as a reduction to inventory by developing an expectation for the amount and comparing our 
expectation to the amount recorded by management.
Goodwill – Best Buy Health Reporting Unit — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The goodwill balance 
was $1,383 million as of January 28, 2023, of which $891 million was related to the Best Buy Health reporting unit. The Company uses the discounted cash flow 
model to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, which requires management to make subjective estimates and assumptions related to 
forecasts of cash flows such as revenue growth rates and estimates of the weighted average cost of capital rate. Changes in these assumptions could have a 
significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit exceeded 
its carrying value as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized. 
Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, performing audit procedures to evaluate 
the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of cash flows, such as revenue growth rates, and estimates of the 
weighted average cost of capital rate, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value 
specialists. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of cash flows, such as revenue growth rates and estimates of the weighted average cost of capital rate used by 
management to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit included the following, among others: 

We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the 
Best Buy Health reporting unit, such as controls related to management’s forecasts of future revenue and estimates of the weighted average cost of capital 
rate. 

We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts. 

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts for the new products and services by comparing the forecasts to: (1) the Company’s 
historical revenue growth rates, including for similar existing products and services; (2) internal communications to management and the board of directors; 
(3) underlying source documents, when available, such as customer contracts; and (4) underlying analyses detailing business strategies and growth plans. 

We inquired of operating and sales management teams to determine whether the judgments and assumptions used in the future revenue projections were 
consistent with the strategy and long-range plans for the Best Buy Health reporting unit. 

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital rate by: (1) testing the source 
information underlying the determination of the rate and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations; (2) comparing the rate to market data; and (3) 
developing ranges of independent estimates and comparing those to the rate selected by management.
