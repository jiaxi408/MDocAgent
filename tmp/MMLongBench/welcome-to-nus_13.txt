CARING FOR THE 
COMMUNITY & ENVIRONMENT
HE University’s unstinting support for community service is a tradition 
instilled by our predecessors more than a century ago. As a student, 
you can get involved in many student-driven activities to reach out to 
the less fortunate.
NUS DAY OF SERVICE
The annual NUS Day of Service on 
7 September 2019 saw a record 2,411 NUS 
staff, students and alumni participating 
in community service activities for more 
than 5,500 beneficiaries. It featured some 
54 activities across 10 categories ranging 
from animal welfare, environment and 
sports, to the elderly, children and youth.
RAG AND FLAG 
The annual charity event organised by 
the NUS Students’ Union (NUSSU) is a 
unique tradition established since the 
1950s to inculcate a spirit of giving and 
volunteerism among NUS students. 
It also provides a platform for new 
undergraduates to integrate into the 
NUS community. Over the past five years, 
nearly S$2 million has been raised for 
beneficiaries through NUSSU Rag 
and Flag.
