Because retailers vary in how they record costs of operating their supply chain between cost of sales and SG&A, our gross profit rate and SG&A rate may not be comparable to other retailers' 
corresponding rates. For additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales and SG&A, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In fiscal 2023, we generated $46.3 billion in revenue and our comparable sales declined 9.9%. Our comparable sales decline was due to multiple factors, 
including the following: (1) the lapping of strong sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that were driven by heightened demand during the pandemic for stay-at-
home focused purchases and the benefit of government stimulus payments; (2) the shift of consumer spending back into service areas such as travel and 
entertainment and away from durable goods; and (3) macroeconomic pressures, including high inflation, that resulted in overall softness in customer demand 
within the consumer electronics industry.
Revenue, gross profit rate, SG&A and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2023 were primarily driven by our Domestic segment. For further discussion of 
each segment’s rate changes, see Segment Performance Summary, below.

Comparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation.
The decrease in revenue in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by comparable sales declines across most of our product categories, particularly computing, home 
theater, mobile phones and appliances. Online revenue of $14.2 billion decreased 13.5% on a comparable basis in fiscal 2023. These decreases in revenue 
were primarily due to the reasons described within the Consolidated Results section, above.
