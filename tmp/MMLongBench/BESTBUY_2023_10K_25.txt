We continuously monitor store performance as part of a market-driven, omnichannel strategy. As we approach the expiration of leases, we evaluate various 
options for each location, including whether a store should remain open. In fiscal 2024, we currently expect to close approximately 20 to 30 Best Buy stores and 
to increase the number of Outlet Centers to approximately 30.

Notable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:
• 
Computing and Mobile Phones: The 12.0% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones, wearables and tablets.
• 
Consumer Electronics: The 12.2% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater, digital imaging and headphones.
• 
Appliances: The 5.7% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances.
• 
Entertainment: The 5.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by virtual reality and gaming software.
• 
Services: The 2.5% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by the launch of our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering that includes benefits 
that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services, such as warranty services.
Our gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower product margin rates, including increased promotions, lower services margin rates, driven by 
the incremental customer benefits and associated costs from our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer, and 
higher supply chain costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement 
and an approximately $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.
Our SG&A decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense of approximately $455 million compared to the prior year 
and decreased store payroll expenses. We were below the required thresholds for most short-term incentive compensation performance metrics in the current 
year while lapping short-term incentive amounts near maximum levels in the prior year.
The restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2023 primarily related to employee termination benefits related to an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that 
commenced in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations, as well as optimize our cost structure. Refer 
to Note 3, Restructuring, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Our operating income rate decreased in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the unfavorable gross profit rate described above and decreased leverage from lower 
sales volume on our fixed expenses, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate.
