NUS VOLUNTEER 
NETWORK 
Established in December 2007, 
the NUS Volunteer Network 
comprises the NUS Volunteer 
Action Committee, Red Cross 
Youth – NUS Chapter, Rotaract 
NUS and NUS Students’ 
Community Service Club (CSC). 
This network seeks to provide 
a platform to share ideas, 
experiences and best practices 
relating to volunteering. It also 
serves as a platform to provide 
a wider range of volunteering 
opportunities to the NUS 
community. 
GREEN BAZAAR
To promote responsible 
consumption, yearly or biannual 
clothing swap events are 
organised for students and staff to 
exchange secondhand items. 
The surplus items are donated 
to student-run projects and 
other causes.
PLASTIC BAG TAX SCHEME 
Since 2008, a 10-cent charge per 
plastic bag has been imposed to 
encourage consumers to switch 
from using plastic bags to reusable 
bags at canteens, convenience 
stores and bookstores.
The tax proceeds go to the 
NUS Sustainability Fund that 
supports environmental projects 
run by NUS students. 
PROJECTS 
BOX AND TUMBLER
Projects Box and Tumbler were 
introduced in NUS canteens and 
other selected food and beverage 
outlets in 2010 and 2012 
respectively. These are 
rebate schemes funded by the 
Plastic Bag Tax Scheme, aimed at 
encouraging NUS students and 
staff to bring their own lunch 
boxes and tumblers 
for takeaways. 
REUSABLE BAG LIBRARY
Launched in 2018, 
the Reusable Bag Library provides 
easily accessible alternatives 
to plastic bags at retail outlets 
on campus, such as Cheers 
convenience store. 
Reusable bags are regularly 
refilled at the library racks 
whenever possible. The NUS 
community is encouraged to 
borrow, return and contribute 
additional bags at the 
collection points.
SEEDS OF GOOD PROGRAMME
STUDENT VOLUNTEERS FROM NUS CSC COLLABORATED 
WITH TRANSIENT WORKERS COUNT TOO ON A NEW 
INITIATIVE CALLED “PROJECT WE ARE ONE”
GREEN NUS 
Our environmental student groups 
play a big part in promoting campus 
sustainability and acting as a catalyst 
for change in areas such as resource 
consumption and sustainable lifestyles.
NUS Students Against Violation of the 
Earth (SAVE) is the main environmental 
student group in the University. The group 
initiates campaigns and projects to reduce 
waste and promote nature appreciation, 
including Green Bazaar, Plastic Bag Tax 
Scheme, Projects Box and Tumbler, 
and Reusable Bag Library.
SEEDS OF GOOD PROGRAMME
The community development learning 
programme, jointly launched by NUS 
Office of Student Affairs and NUS Office 
of Alumni Relations on 20 March 2019, 
seeks to empower NUS students to 
collaborate with the community, social 
service organisations and corporations to 
promote social causes or address issues 
faced by communities both within NUS 
and beyond. The student teams have 
since initiated over 80 projects with 
community partners of their choice and 
engaged in activities to enhance the 
well-being of the community and/or 
environment.
