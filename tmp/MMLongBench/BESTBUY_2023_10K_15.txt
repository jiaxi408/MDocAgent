Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model.
As an employer of more than 90,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations 
including, for example:
• 
the organization of unions and related rules that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor Relations Board frequently 
considers;
• 
laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors and the classification of employees and independent contractors; 
and
• 
laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or 
impact the level of service we are able to provide.
Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability.
Regulatory and Legal Risks
We are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments that could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our 
operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to:
• 
the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;
• 
the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, 
carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;
• 
the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to 
manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;
• 
the financial, operational and business impact of evolving regulations governing data privacy and security, including limitations on the collection, use or 
sharing of information; consumer rights to access, delete or limit/opt-out of the use of information; or litigation arising from new private rights of action; 
• 
the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor Relations Board rule changes; 
healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, 
copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other future legislation that could affect how we operate 
and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;
• 
the impact of litigation, including class-action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and
• 
the impact of changes in the federal executive and legislative branches on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies, such as 
economic, fiscal, tax, retail, labor and social policies.
The impact of geopolitical tensions, including the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade 
agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In 
particular, political or trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China could lead to the imposition of tariffs or other trade actions that could 
adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects.
Further, the impact of potential changes in U.S., state or other countries’ tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, could adversely 
affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. 
Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management’s attention and resources from other 
matters.
Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on 
the environment, which could result in future tax, compliance, transportation and utility cost increases. Our own climate change-oriented initiatives, such as our 
attempts to increase energy efficiency during store construction and remodeling, could also increase our costs. In addition, changes to the environment, both 
long-term and short-term, may affect consumer shopping behavior in a way that negatively impacts our revenue, revenue mix and profitability.
