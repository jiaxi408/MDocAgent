Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to operations in our International segment. On a limited basis, we utilize 
foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases, recognized receivable and payable balances 
and our investment in our Canadian operations. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows, as well as 
net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments 
and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. Refer to Note 6, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these instruments.
During fiscal 2023, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar compared 
to the prior-year period, which had a negative overall impact on our revenue as this foreign currency revenue translated into less U.S. dollars. We estimate that 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately $162 million. The impact of foreign exchange rate 
fluctuations on our net earnings in fiscal 2023 was not significant.
