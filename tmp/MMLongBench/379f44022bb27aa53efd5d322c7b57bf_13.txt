Residents meetings were held twice a year, the most recent
in January 2015. The recent upgrading of the garden was
discussed and staff proposed to support people to use the
garden more often. The garden was used by one person
who was independently mobile and people said they were
occasionally asked if they would like to go in to the garden,
“if it was sunny”.
Staff felt supported and they had access to advice when
they needed it. Staff said the registered manager and
deputy manager were available to assist them with
guidance when they needed it. Staff could gain further
qualifications if they wanted to and one member of staff
said they were, “really grateful for the opportunity” to do so.
Staff meetings were held regularly, the most recent in May
2015. Minutes from staff meetings showed staff were
thanked for their continued hard work which was
acknowledged as demanding and stressful. The registered
manager reminded staff that support was available at any
time from them.
Is the service well-led?
