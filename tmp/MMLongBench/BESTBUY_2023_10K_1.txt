provide a “safe harbor” for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies. With the exception of 
historical information, the matters discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements and may be identified by the use of words such 
as “anticipate,” “appear,” “approximate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “foresee,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “outlook,” 
“plan,” “possible,” “project” “seek,” “should,” “would,” and other words and terms of similar meaning or the negatives thereof. Such statements reflect our current 
view with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. A variety of factors could cause our future results to differ 
materially from the anticipated results expressed in such forward-looking statements. Readers should review Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for a description of important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements 
made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we 
undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
