The highest innings total scored in Test cricket came in the series between Sri Lanka and India in August 1997.
Playing in the first Test at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, the hosts posted a first innings total of 952/6d.
This broke the longstanding record of 903/7d which England set against Australia in the final Test of the 1938
Ashes series at The Oval. This in turn broke England's 849 all out against the West Indies in 1930.[36]
