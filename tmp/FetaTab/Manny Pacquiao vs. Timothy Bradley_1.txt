Timothy Bradley by split decision
rematch, but Pacquiao and Cotto
could not agree on the weight for
the fight. Pacquiao wanted the
147-pound welterweight limit,
which Cotto said was too low for
him, and he accepted a fight with
Mayweather.[5] 
Also 
in 
the
running to face Pacquiao were
Lamont 
Peterson 
and 
Juan
Manuel Marquez. Ultimately, it
was Timothy Bradley who came to terms, agreeing to move up a weight class to challenge Pacquiao for his
title.[5]
Bradley came into the fight with a somewhat lower profile than a typical Pacquiao opponent. In January 2011,
he won a 10th-round technical decision in a junior welterweight title unification bout against Devon
Alexander.[4] Previously, he had beaten then world-champion Lamont Peterson to claim the title.[4] After the
fight with Alexander, Bradley rejected an offer to fight Amir Khan and further unify the 140-pound division. He
signed with Top Rank and was given a co-feature slot on the Pacquiao-Marquez III pay-per-view card in
November. In his match, Bradley beat former lightweight champion Joel Casamayor in an eight-round fight.[6]
Prior to the Pacquiao fight, Bradley was ranked as one of the top 10 pound for pound fighters in the world. In a
show of confidence, Bradley had "rematch" posters printed up, implying he would win the fight.[7]
Pacquiao entered the fight as a substantial favorite, among both bookmakers and fans. Bradley entered the fight
as a 7-2 underdog in the Vegas line. The glove weight was set at 8 ounces each. Midway through the first round,
the crowd spontaneously began to chant "Manny, Manny, Manny ..."[4]
Throughout the fight, action was fast-paced, with Pacquiao landing the harder punches.[4] He appeared to take
control early, beating Bradley on most exchanges.[7] However, Bradley did make good use of the punches he
was able to throw, connecting on some of them.[8] Pacquiao won the first round, according to two of the three
judges. Bradley was the more aggressive fighter in the second, backing Pacquiao against the ropes at one point.
However, Pacquiao's patience paid off as he countered effectively at the end of the round.[8] Two of the judges
awarded the round to Bradley. According to trainer Joel Diaz, Bradley hurt his ankle during the round, but chose
to press on.[7] Pacquaio took control in the third round, winning on all three judges' cards. By the end of the
round, Bradley "looked stunned".[8]
During the fourth and fifth rounds, Bradley seemed to be visibly hurting.[7] In the fourth round, Bradley was
cautioned for a low blow, and forced on defense throughout. During the final seconds of the round, Bradley
appeared close to going down multiple times.[8] Pacquiao remained on the offensive during the fifth, but
Bradley managed to land some counterpunches.[8] All three judges gave the fourth round to Pacquiao, but only
one awarded him the fifth.
Pacquiao dominated the sixth round, trapping Bradley in the corner, and getting off several consecutive
unanswered punches.[8] All judges gave Pacquiao the sixth round.
