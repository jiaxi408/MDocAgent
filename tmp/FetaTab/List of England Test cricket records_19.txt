The worst figures in a match in Test cricket were taken by South Africa's Imran Tahir in the second Test against
Australia at the Adelaide Oval in November 2012. He returned figures of 0/180 from his 23 overs in the first
innings and 0/80 off 14 in the third innings for a total of 0/260 from 37 overs.[132] He claimed the record in his
final over when two runs came from it – enough for him to pass the previous record of 0/259, set 54 years
prior.[133][134][135]
The worst figures by an England player came in the fourth Test of the 1989–90 tour of the West Indies when
Devon Malcolm returned figures of 0/142 and 0/46 for a total of 0/188 off 43 overs.[136]

England's seventh Test tour of South Africa in 1913–14 saw the record set for the most wickets taken by a
bowler in a Test series. English paceman Sydney Barnes played in four of the five matches and achieved a total
of 49 wickets to his name. Jim Laker sits second on the list with 46 wickets taken during the 1956 Ashes
series.[21]
