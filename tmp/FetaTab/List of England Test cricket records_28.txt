The highest Test partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the Sri Lankan pairing of Kumar Sangakkara and
Mahela Jayawardene who put together a third wicket partnership of 624 runs during the first Test against South
Africa in July 2006. This broke the record of 576 runs set by their compatriots Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan
Mahanama against India in 1997. New Zealand's Andrew Jones and Martin Crowe hold the third-highest Test
partnership with 467 made in 1991 against Sri Lanka. The English pairing of Peter May and Colin Cowdrey
together scored 411 for the fourth wicket against the West Indies in 1957 to place themselves thirteenth on the
list.[172]
