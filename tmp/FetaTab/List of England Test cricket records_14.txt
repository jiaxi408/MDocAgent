Bowling figures refers to the number of the wickets a bowler has taken and the number of runs conceded.[111]
There have been two occasions in Test cricket where a bowler has taken all ten wickets in a single innings – Jim
Laker of England took 10/53 against Australia in 1956 and India's Anil Kumble in 1999 returned figures of
10/74 against Pakistan. George Lohmann, one of fifteen bowlers who have taken nine wickets in a Test match
innings, sits third on the list taking figures of 9/28 against South Africa in 1896.[112]

A bowler's bowling figures in a match is the sum of the wickets taken and the runs conceded over both innings.
No bowler in the history of Test cricket has taken all 20 wickets in a match. The closest to do so was English
spin bowler Jim Laker. During the fourth Test of the 1956 Ashes series, Laker took 9/37 in the first innings and
10/53 in the second to finish with match figures of 19/90.[114] Sydney Barnes's figures of 17/159, taken in the
second Test of the 1913–14 South African tour, is the second-best in Test cricket history.[115]
