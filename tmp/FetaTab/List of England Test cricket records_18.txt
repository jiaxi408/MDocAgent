A ten-wicket haul refers to a bowler taking ten or more wickets in a
match over two innings.
As with the five-wicket hauls above, Muttiah Muralitharan leads Shane Warne in taking the most ten-wicket
hauls in Test cricket with Muralitharan having taken 22 to Warne's 10. Sydney Barnes of England is in equal
sixth with three other bowlers, each achieving the feat on seven occasions.[126]

The worst figures in a single innings in Test cricket came in the third Test between the West Indies at home to
Pakistan in 1958. Pakistan's Khan Mohammad returned figures of 0/259 from his 54 overs in the second innings
of the match.[127][128] The worst figures by an England player are 0/169 that came off the bowling of Tich
Freeman in his final Test appearance.[129][130]
