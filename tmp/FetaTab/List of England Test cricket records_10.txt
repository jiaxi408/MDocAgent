A half-century is a score of between 50 and 99 runs. Statistically, once a batsman's score reaches 100, it is no
longer considered a half-century but a century.
Sachin Tendulkar of India has scored the most half-centuries in Test cricket with 68. He is followed by the West
Indies' Shivnarine Chanderpaul on 66, India's Rahul Dravid and Allan Border of Australia are third on 63 and in
seventh with 57 fifties to his name, England's Alastair Cook.[90]
