An umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to
the Laws of Cricket. Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field,
whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire
looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only
for on-field umpires.
Steve Bucknor of the West Indies holds the record for the most Test
matches umpired with 128. He is followed by the currently active Aleem
Dar from Pakistan who has stood in 123 Test matches as of
February 2019 and South Africa's Rudi Koertzen who officiated in 108.
The most experienced Englishman is David Shepherd who is fifth on the
list with 92 Test matches umpired. Dickie Bird, who previously held the
record 
with 
66
