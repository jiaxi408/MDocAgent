The youngest player to play in a Test match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 227 days.
Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 24 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of
Raza's age at the time.[163] The youngest cricketer to play Test cricket for England was Brian Close who at the
age of 18 years and 149 days debuted in the third Test of the series against New Zealand in July 1949.[164]
