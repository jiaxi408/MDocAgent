A bowler takes the wicket of a batsman when the form of dismissal is
bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped or hit wicket. If the batsman
is dismissed by run out, obstructing the field, handling the ball, hitting
the ball twice or timed out the bowler does not receive credit.
Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan holds the record for taking the
most wickets in Test cricket with 800, followed by Australia's Shane
Warne who previously held the record with 708.[108][109] James
Anderson of England is fourth on the list with 575 Test wickets to his
name as of February 2019 and in September 2018 he passed Australia's
Glenn McGrath to become the fast bowler with the most Test
wickets.[110] Stuart Broad, with 437, is the second highest England Test
wicket-taker and seventh overall.[18][108]
