A run is the basic means of scoring in cricket. A run is scored when the
batsman hits the ball with his bat and with his partner runs the length of
22 yards (20 m) of the pitch.[80]
India's Sachin Tendulkar has scored the most runs in Test cricket with
15,921. Second is Ricky Ponting of Australia with 13,378 ahead of
Jacques Kallis from South Africa in third with 13,289. Alastair Cook, the
only England batsman who has scored more than 10,000 runs in Test
cricket, is in fifth with 12,472.[9]

The first Test of the 2003–04 series of the Southern Cross Trophy, contested between Australia and Zimbabwe,
at the WACA Ground saw Matthew Hayden of Australia set the highest Test score with 380, surpassing the West
Indies' Brian Lara's 375 scored against England in April 1994 at the Antigua Recreation Ground.[81] Six months
after Hayden set the record, the West Indian claimed it back scoring 400 not out against the same opposition and
on the same ground.[82] Len Hutton's 364 against Australia during the final Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The
Oval is the sixth highest individual score in Test cricket. Wally Hammond's 336, scored against New Zealand in
1933, is the third highest not out Test innings and the ninth highest overall.[83] Hutton's, Hammond's and Andy
Sandham's 325 against the West Indies in 1930 were Test record scores at the time of posting.[84]
