A Test match is won when one side has scored more runs than the total
runs scored by the opposing side during their two innings. If both sides
have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last
has the higher aggregate of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This
indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing
side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs
scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by an
innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a
win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to
fall.[44]
The fifth Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval saw England win by
an innings and 579 runs, the largest victory by an innings in Test cricket
history. The next largest victory was Australia's win against South Africa
in the first Test of the 2001–02 tour at the Wanderers Stadium, where the
tourists won by an innings and 360 runs.[43]
