In cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will
continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.
A wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership
is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then
commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the
second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new
batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no
batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.
English batsmen hold three Test wicket partnerships records, all set since 2010. Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow
came together in the second Test of the 2015–16 series against South Africa at Newlands Cricket Ground and
put together a sixth wicket partnership of 399 runs.[166][167] The recently retired Jonathan Trott and the still
active Stuart Broad set the highest eighth wicket partnership of 332 runs at Lord's in August 2010 against
Pakistan.[168] The final record is the tenth wicket partnership of 198 which was set by Joe Root and James
Anderson. This came in the first Test against India at Trent Bridge in July 2014.[169][170]
