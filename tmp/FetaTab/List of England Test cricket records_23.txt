Caught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket.[h] A fair catch is defined as a fielder
catching the ball, from a legal delivery, fully within the field of play without it bouncing when the ball has
touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat.[140][141] The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located
behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order
batsmen.[153][154]
India's Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most catches in Test cricket by a non-wicket-keeper with 210,
followed by Mahela Jayawardene of Sri Lanka on 205 and South African Jacques Kallis with 200. Former
captain Alastair Cook is the highest ranked England player in sixth, securing 175 catches in his Test career.[155]

The 1920–21 Ashes series, in which Australia whitewashed England 5–0 for the first time,[156] saw the record
set for the most catches taken by a non-wicket-keeper in a Test series. Australian all-rounder Jack Gregory took
15 catches in the series as well as 23 wickets.[157] Greg Chappell and K. L. Rahul are joint second behind
Gregory with 14 catches taken during the 1974–75 Ashes series and the 2018 India tour of England respectively.
The same series saw Alastair Cook become the highest placed England player in equal fourth with 13 catches
taken alongside Bob Simpson, Brian Lara and Rahul Dravid.[158]
