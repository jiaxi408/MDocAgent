Davis died at the age of 88 on June 1, 2014, at a hospital in San Antonio,

fall in her bathroom in her San Antonio residence, in which she lived
with Bishop Frey and his wife, Barbara.[17][18][19] Sources close to her

complete shock.[20] She is interred in the Saint Helena's Columbarium
and Memorial Gardens in Boerne, Texas.
