Brad Haddin holds the Test cricket record for the most dismissals taken by a wicket-keeper in a series. He took
29 catches during the 2013 Ashes series which broke the previous record held by fellow Australian Rod Marsh
when he took 28 catches in the 1982–83 Ashes series. Jack Russell of England is equal third with 27 dismissals
taken during the 1995–96 tour of South Africa.[150]
