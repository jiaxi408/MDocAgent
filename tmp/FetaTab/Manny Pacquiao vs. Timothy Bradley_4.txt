Sanchez won via unanimous decision[11]
Following the announcement of the decision, the crowd booed loudly.[12] Pacquiao appeared to be stunned by
the result. Fight promoter Bob Arum was irate, and said that he was worried about boxing's credibility in the
aftermath of the decision.[7] He also questioned the competence of the judges.[13] Arum also stated that before
the scorecards were read out, Bradley told him "I tried hard but I couldn't beat the guy."[7][14]A few reporters
questioned Bob Arum's sincerity in his comments and hinted that he was in on the bad decisions. One reporter,
Tito Garcia of FanvsFan.com, interrupted Arum's press conference by loudly accusing Arum of fixing the fight.
Garcia was physically ejected from the press conference.
Pacquiao said he was shocked by the result, but accepted the decision respectfully, saying "I did my best. I guess
my best wasn't good enough," adding, "He never hurt me with his punches, most of them landed on my arms."[7]
Immediately after the fight, Bradley stated, "Every round was pretty close. I got to go home and view the tape
and see if I really won."[15] He later remarked, "I thought I won the fight. I didn't think he was as good as
everyone says he was. I didn't feel his power."[7]
The decision was criticized by many commentators. The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times scored the
fight 117–111 in favor of Pacquiao,[7][8] while ESPN and Harold Lederman of HBO both scored the fight 119–
109, also in Pacquiao's favor.[16][17] ESPN boxing analyst and longtime trainer Teddy Atlas said that Pacquiao
clearly won, and that it was a case of either incompetence or corruption. He added that boxing needs a national
commission, so that judges can be accountable for their decisions.[18] According to the AP's count, Pacquiao
landed 253 punches to Bradley's 159.[7] Former champion Oscar De La Hoya said that Bradley should have
refused the title belt, and Pacquiao had won the fight.[19]
However, not everyone was upset by the result. Corbin Middlemas of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
said the fight was very close and difficult to score. "For all of the sports vices, this [decision] wasn't one of
them," he said.[4] The only poor decision would have been to award either fighter victory by a large margin, he
added.[4]
Following the event, Bradley announced that he would welcome a rematch,[7] that of which was also held at the
MGM Grand Garden Arena on April 12, 2014. Pacquiao defeated Bradley via unanimous decision and regained
the WBO title. Manny Pacquiao vs. Timothy Bradley III then took place almost two years later on April 9, 2016.
Pacquiao again defeated Bradley via unanimous decision and knocked him down twice along the way.
