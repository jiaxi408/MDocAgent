A bowler's bowling average is the total number of runs they have
conceded divided by the number of wickets they have taken.
Nineteenth century English medium pacer George Lohmann holds the
record for the best career average in Test cricket with 10.75. J. J. Ferris,
one of fifteen cricketers to have played Test cricket for more than one
team,[119] is second behind Lohmann with an overall career average of
12.70 runs per wicket. Billy Barnes is third on the list, finishing his Test
career with an average of 15.54.[117]
