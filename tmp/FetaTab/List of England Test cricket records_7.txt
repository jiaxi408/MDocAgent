Only one match in over 140 years of Test cricket has been decided by a margin of one run, the fourth Test of the
West Indian tour of Australia in 1992–93 where the visitors secured victory. The equal third narrowest defeat
was England's loss in the fourth Test of the 1902 Ashes series at Old Trafford. Requiring 32 runs to win with six
wickets in hand, England lost the match by a margin of three runs.[56][75][76]
