A triple century is a score of 300 or more runs in a single innings.
Four cricketers hold the Test record for the most triple centuries scored with two – Don Bradman, India's
Virender Sehwag and West Indians Chris Gayle and Brian Lara. Five England players have scored a single Test
triple century with former captain Graham Gooch the most recent to do so in 1990.[102][103]

series. Alastair Cook's 766 runs scored during the 2010–11 Ashes series ranks in 14th.[93]
