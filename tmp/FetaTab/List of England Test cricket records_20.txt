The wicket-keeper is a specialist fielder who stands behind the stumps
being guarded by the batsman on strike and is the only member of the
fielding side allowed to wear gloves and leg pads.[139]
A wicket-keeper can be credited with the dismissal of a batsman in two
ways, caught or stumped. A fair catch is taken when the ball is caught
fully within the field of play without it bouncing after the ball has
touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat,[140][141] while a
stumping occurs when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket while the batsman is out of his ground and not
attempting a run.[142]
South Africa's Mark Boucher has taken the most dismissals in Test cricket as a designated wicket-keeper with
555, followed by Adam Gilchrist of Australia on 416. England's Alan Knott, who took 269 dismissals during his
95-Test match career, is eighth on the list. He is followed by his compatriots Matt Prior and Alec Stewart in
ninth and tenth with 256 and 241 dismissals respectively.[143]
