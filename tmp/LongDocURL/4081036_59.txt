Section 1. Designation and Amount. The shares of this series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this certificate of designations,
preferences and rights (the “Certificate of Designations”) shall be designated as "Series A Participating Preferred Stock" (the “Series A
Preferred Stock”) and the number of shares constituting the Series A Preferred Stock shall be one million (1,000,000). Such number of shares
may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock to a number less than the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding plus the number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities
issued by the Corporation convertible into Series A Preferred Stock.
 
Section 2. Dividends and Distributions.
 
(a)
Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any other stock) ranking
prior and superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, in preference to the holders of shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the “Common Stock”), quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of
March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a “Quarterly Dividend Payment Date”),
commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock,
in an amount (if any) per share (rounded to the nearest cent), subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to one hundred
(100) times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and one hundred (100) times the aggregate per share amount (payable in
kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or
fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common
Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
(by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of
Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to
such event under the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(b)
The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in
paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in
shares of Common Stock).
