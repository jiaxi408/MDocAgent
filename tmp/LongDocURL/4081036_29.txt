 
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.
Legal Proceedings
We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with customers, resellers, distributors, integrators and suppliers. Most of our historical agreements require us
to defend and/or indemnify the other party against intellectual property infringement claims brought by a third party with respect to our products. From time to time, we
also indemnify customers and business partners for damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur relating to personal injury, personal property damage, product
liability, and environmental claims relating to the use of our products and services or resulting from the acts or omissions of us, our employees, authorized agents or
subcontractors. Management cannot reasonably estimate any potential losses, but these claims could result in material liability for us (see Note 6 to our unaudited
consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).
ITEM 1A.
Risk Factors
In addition to other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, which could materially affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. The risks described in our Form 10-
K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.
