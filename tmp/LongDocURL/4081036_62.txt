 
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior to any distribution made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior to the Series A
Preferred Stock, an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to one hundred (100) times
the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid
dividends (the “Series A Liquidation Preference”). In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full
of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, that rank on a parity with the
Series A Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their
respective liquidation preferences. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in
shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to
such event under the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Section 7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other
transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property,
then in any such case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per
share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to one hundred (100) times the aggregate amount of stock, securities,
cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or
exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common
Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise
than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case
the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by
multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such
event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Section 8. Amendment. So long as any share of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, neither the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation nor this Certificate of Designation shall be amended in any manner, including in a merger or consolidation, which would alter,
change, or repeal the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least two​ thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.
 
Section 9. Rank. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution
and winding up, junior to all series of Preferred Stock, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise.
