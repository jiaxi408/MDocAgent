Contract Liabilities
Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposits that arise when amounts are billed to or collected from customers in advance of revenue recognition.
Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred
revenue, long-term. The change in deferred revenue in the first quarter ended April 30, 2021 is due to new billings in advance of revenue recognition offset by revenue
recognized during the period.
