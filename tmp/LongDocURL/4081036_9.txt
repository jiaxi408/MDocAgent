 
Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
We record goodwill when consideration paid in a business acquisition exceeds the value of the net assets acquired. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable at that time but such estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated
events or circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have determined that there is a
single reporting unit for the purpose of conducting the goodwill impairment assessment. Goodwill impairment is recorded if the amount of our carrying value exceeds our
fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Factors that could lead to a future impairment include material uncertainties such as a significant reduction in
projected revenues, a deterioration of projected financial performance, future acquisitions and/or mergers, and a decline in our market value as a result of a significant
decline in our stock price. There were no impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2021 or the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern
of consumption of the economic benefits or, if that pattern cannot be readily determined, on a straight-line basis.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets primarily consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups
of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are
less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. Determining the
fair value of long-lived assets includes significant judgment by management, and different judgments could yield different results.
We assess the useful lives and possible impairment of existing recognized long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that it is
more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. Factors considered important which could trigger a review include:
 
•
significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;
 
•
significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;
 
•
identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit;
 
•
significant negative industry or economic trends;
 
•
a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and
 
•
a decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value.
Determining whether a triggering event has occurred involves significant judgment.
Revenue Recognition
Overview
We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective February 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective
method. Our revenue is derived from sales of software licenses and associated third party hardware and support services, as well as professional services and support fees
related to our software licenses.
The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below:
 
•
identify the customer contract;
 
•
identify performance obligations that are distinct;
 
•
determine the transaction price;
 
•
allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and
 
•
recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.
