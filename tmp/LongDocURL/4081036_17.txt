Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Equity Plans
2011 Compensation and Incentive Plan
Our 2011 Compensation and Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”) provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted
stock units (“RSUs”), deferred stock units (“DSUs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”) and other equity based non-stock option awards as determined by the plan
administrator to our officers, employees, consultants and directors. We may satisfy awards upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of stock units with newly
issued shares or treasury shares. The Board of Directors is responsible for the administration of the 2011 Plan and determining the terms of each award, award exercise
price, the number of shares for which each award is granted and the rate at which each award vests. In certain instances, the Board of Directors may elect to modify the
terms of an award. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan is 9,300,000. Additionally, outstanding awards under the 2005 Equity Compensation
and Incentive Plan that, since adoption of the 2011 Plan, expire, terminate, or are surrendered or canceled without having been fully exercised are available for issuance
under the 2011 Plan. As of April 30, 2021, there were 3,359,383 shares available for future grant.      
Nonemployee members of the Board of Directors may elect to receive DSUs or stock options in lieu of RSUs. The number of units subject to the DSUs is determined as
of the grant date and shall fully vest one year from the grant date. The shares underlying the DSUs are not vested and issued until the earlier of the director ceasing to be a
member of the Board of Directors (provided such time is subsequent to the first day of the succeeding fiscal year) or immediately prior to a change in control.
Option awards may be granted to employees at an exercise price per share of not less than 100% of the fair market value per common share on the date of the grant.
Option awards granted under the 2011 Plan generally vest over a period of one to three years and expire ten years from the date of the grant.
We have a Long-Term Incentive Program, adopted in fiscal 2016, under which the named executive officers and other of our key employees may receive long-term
equity-based incentive awards, which are intended to align the interests of our named executive officers and other key employees with the long-term interests of our
stockholders and to emphasize and reinforce our focus on team success. Long-term equity-based incentive compensation awards are made in the form of stock options,
RSUs and PSUs subject to vesting based in part on the extent to which employment continues. 
2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), six-month offering periods begin on October 1 and April 1 of each year during which eligible employees
may elect to purchase shares of our common stock according to the terms of the offering.  On each purchase date, eligible employees can purchase our stock at a price per
share equal to 85% of the closing price of our common stock on the exercise date, but no less than par value.  The maximum number of shares of our common stock
authorized for sale under the ESPP is 1,150,000 shares, of which 1,075,024 remain available under the ESPP as of April 30, 2021. Under the ESPP, 5,702 shares were
purchased during the first three months of fiscal 2021. There were no shares purchased under the ESPP during the first three months of fiscal 2022 as the Company
suspended the ESPP as of April 1, 2020 and is still evaluating when the suspension will be lifted, if at all.
Award Activity
In the first three months of fiscal 2022, we granted 830,000 option awards and 109,489 RSU awards with a total grant date fair value of $1.2 million. In the first three
months of fiscal 2022, we canceled 802,500 option awards and 171,308 RSU awards, including PSUs.
