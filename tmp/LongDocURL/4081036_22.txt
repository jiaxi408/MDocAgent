 
In March 2019, our Board approved and adopted a tax benefits preservation plan (the “Tax Benefits Preservation Plan”) to deter acquisitions of our common stock that
would potentially limit our ability to use NOLs to reduce our potential future federal income tax obligations. In connection with the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, we
declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 15, 2019 to our stockholders of record
on that date. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan was approved by our stockholders at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.
In February 2021, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which registered an indeterminate number of Securities using a “shelf”
registration or continuous offering process. Under this shelf registration, we may, from time to time, sell any combination of the securities in one or more offerings up to a
total aggregate offering price of $200 million. The shelf registration was declared effective on March 16, 2021.
In connection with the shelf registration statement, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Aegis Capital Corp. on March 30, 2021, to issue and sell
10,323,484 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a public offering price of $1.85 per share (the “Offering”). The Offering closed on April 1, 2021 and
resulted in approximately $17.5 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of 6.5%, or $0.12025 per share of common stock, and offering
expenses of approximately $0.2 million. In addition to the Offering, the Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option (the “Underwriter Option”) to purchase up
to an additional 1,548,522 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $1.85 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The Underwriter Option was not
exercised and has expired.
In March 2021, we entered into a Sublease Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) which terminated the sublease with respect to our former headquarters
in Waltham, Massachusetts, effective March 21, 2021. In connection with the early termination of the sublease, the Company is to pay the sublandlord a termination
payment of approximately $0.4 million, of which $0.3 million was paid during the three months ended April 30, 2021, and the remaining $0.1 million was paid
subsequent to quarter end. The Company also wrote off all related operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities as of the termination date, resulting in a $0.3 million
non-cash gain, which partially offset the loss on the termination payments. The net $0.1 million loss on lease termination is reported as a component of severance and
restructuring expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of April 30, 2021. Prior to the execution of the Termination Agreement, the
sublease had been scheduled to expire in February 2025. As a result of the Termination Agreement, we expect annualized savings of approximately $600 thousand in
facilities costs for each of the next four years.
