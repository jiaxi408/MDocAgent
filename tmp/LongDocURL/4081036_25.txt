due to a $0.1 million increase in outside professional services and no bad debt expense or recoveries as compared to the $0.3 million recovery of bad debt in the prior
period offset by a $0.3 million reduction in salaries and compensation and a reduction in other general expenditures driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Severance and Restructuring Costs

Severance and restructuring costs remained constant for the three months ended April 30, 2021 as compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020. Severance and
restructuring costs for the three months ended April 30, 2021 consisted primarily of employee related termination benefits for the restructuring of our finance department
and facility related closure costs, including a $0.1 million net loss on our Waltham lease termination. Severance and restructuring costs for the three months ended April
30, 2020 consisted primarily of employee related termination benefits due to a reduction in headcount driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The principal components of other expense, net were interest income, net of less than $0.1 million and foreign exchange loss, net of $0.3 million for the three months
ended April 30, 2021 and interest income, net of $0.1 million and foreign exchange loss, net of $0.3 million for the three months ended April 30, 2020. Our foreign
exchange loss, net is primarily due to the revaluation of intercompany notes.
Income Tax Provision (Benefit)
We recorded an income tax provision of less than $0.1 million and an income tax benefit of less than $0.1 million for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and April
30, 2020, respectively. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 and in future periods may fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of changes in our jurisdictional forecasts
where losses cannot be benefitted due to the existence of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, changes in actual results versus our estimates, or changes in tax
laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof.
We review all available evidence to evaluate the recovery of deferred tax assets, including the recent history of losses in all tax jurisdictions, as well as our ability to
generate income in future periods. As of April 30, 2021, due to the uncertainty related to the ultimate use of certain deferred income tax assets, we have recorded a
valuation allowance on certain deferred assets.
