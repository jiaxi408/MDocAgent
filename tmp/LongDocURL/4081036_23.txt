Two customers accounted for 18% and 16% of total revenue for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and two customers accounted for 15% and 13% of total revenue
for the three months ended April 30, 2021. See Part I Item I, Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to this Form 10-Q for more information.
International revenue accounted for 56% and 66% of total revenue in the three months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in international sales as
a percentage of total revenue in the three months ended April 30, 2021 as compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020 is primarily due to a decrease in
international revenue at a higher rate than U.S. revenue primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Product Revenue
Product revenue decreased by $1.5 million for the three months ended April 30, 2021 as compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020. The decrease for the three
months ended April 30, 2021 was primarily due to the shift to our Framework sales model, which did not include any third-party hardware, and a decrease in legacy
product sales in which we would procure and sell third-party hardware to our customers.
Service Revenue
Service revenue decreased by $0.4 million for the three months ended April 30, 2021 as compared to the three months ended April 30, 2020. The decrease for the three
months ended April 30, 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in our maintenance and support revenue provided on post warranty contracts as customers continue to
provide their own solutions and legacy products are decommissioned.
Gross Profit and Margin
Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of resold third-party products and services, purchased components and subassemblies, labor and overhead relating to the
assembly, testing and implementation and ongoing maintenance of complete systems.
