1.4 Refrigeration
There is a refrigeration unit that functions with gas refrigerant R-134a, without CFC and
equipped with a 12 cm3, capable of lowering the temperature of the container to 3 OC
with a room temperature of 32 OC without direct sunlight.
In tests performed at a room temperature of 32 OC, a relative humidity of 75%, and with
the product at room temperature, when the machine is connected for the first time it
took 3 hours for the products to reach 3 OC.
The entire container can be maintained at a single temperature or may be divided into two
sections with different temperatures.
The temperature is controlled by the Control Card which uses a digital electronic ther-
mometer located in the lower part of the body which continuosly monitors the tempera-
ture of the product container.
Thermometric sensor
When the machine operates at a certain temperature, the minimum programmable tem-
perature is 3 OC.  However, the temperature of the product container will vary between 2
OC and 4 OC, that is, the cold group disconnection occurs at 1 OC below the programmed
temperature and reconnection at 1 OC above the programmed temperature.
When the container has been divided into two different temperature zones, the minimum
possible temperature is 3 OC in the lower section and 12 O in the upper one.  In this case
group disconnection will take place when the programmed temperature is reached and
reconnection will occur when the temperature surpasses the programmed temperature
by 1 OC.
If for any reason the cold group should be functioning continuously for four hours, the
control card will automatically disconnect it for 30 minutes to permit defrosting and im-
prove the group's performance.
If the groups stops for temperature reasons, it will remain so for a minimum of 10 minutes
and if it does so due to a power outage, the group will take 1 minute to resume operation.
All of these measures are designed to improve the group's performance.
