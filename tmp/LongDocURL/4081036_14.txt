Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the estimated fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We are required to
perform an impairment test related to our goodwill annually, which we perform during the third quarter of each fiscal year or sooner if we identify certain events or
circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the estimated fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount. The following table represents the changes in
goodwill since January 31, 2021:
