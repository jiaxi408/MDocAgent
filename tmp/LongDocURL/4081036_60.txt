 
 
(c)
Dividends due pursuant to paragraph (A) of this Section shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares,
unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on
such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a
date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and
before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a
share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall
be not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
 
Section 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
 
(a)
Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle
the holder thereof to one hundred (100) votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the
Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or
combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in
shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to
which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator
of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(b)
Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, including any other
certificate of designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as
one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
 
(c)
Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise required by law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no
special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set
forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
