In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into the Termination Agreement which terminated the sublease with respect to our former headquarters in Waltham,
Massachusetts, effective March 21, 2021. In connection with the early termination of the sublease, the Company is to pay the sublandlord a termination payment of
approximately $0.4 million, of which $0.3 million was paid during the three months ended April 30, 2021, and the remaining $0.1 million was paid subsequent to quarter
end. The Company also wrote off all related operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities as of the termination date, resulting in a $0.3 million non-cash gain, which
partially offset the loss on the termination payments. The net $0.1 million loss on lease termination is reported as a component of severance and restructuring expense on
the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ended April 30, 2021. Prior to the execution of the Termination Agreement, the
sublease had been scheduled to expire in February 2025.

Severance and Restructuring Costs
During the three months ended April 30, 2021, we incurred severance and restructuring costs of $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, primarily for employee-
related termination benefits in relation to the restructuring of our finance department and expenses related to the closure of our leased facility in Waltham, Massachusetts.
