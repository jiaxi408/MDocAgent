Income Taxes
Each interim period is considered an integral part of the annual period and, accordingly, we measure our income tax expense using an estimated annual effective tax
rate.  A company is required, at the end of each interim reporting period, to make its best estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year and use that rate
to provide for income taxes on a current year-to-date basis, as adjusted for discrete taxable events that occur during the interim period.
We recorded an income tax provision of less than $0.1 million and an income tax benefit of less than $0.1 million for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and April
30, 2020, respectively. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 and in future periods may fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of changes in our jurisdictional forecasts
where losses cannot be benefitted due to the existence of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, changes in actual results versus our estimates, or changes in tax
laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof.
 
We review all available evidence to evaluate the recovery of deferred tax assets, including the recent history of losses in all tax jurisdictions, as well as our ability to
generate income in future periods. As of April 30, 2021, due to the uncertainty related to the ultimate use of certain deferred income tax assets, we have recorded a
valuation allowance on certain deferred assets.
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. We have closed out an audit with the Internal
Revenue Service through fiscal 2013; however, the taxing authorities will still have the ability to review the propriety of certain tax attributes created in closed years if
such tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year, such as our federal research and development credit carryovers.
On March 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved and adopted a tax benefits preservation plan (the “Tax Benefits Preservation Plan”) to potentially limit our ability to
use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes (“NOLs”) to reduce our potential future federal income tax obligations.  In connection with the Tax
Benefits Preservation Plan, we declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 15, 2019
to our stockholders of record on that date. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan expires no later than March 4, 2022, and was approved by our stockholders at our 2019
annual meeting of stockholders on July 11, 2019.
