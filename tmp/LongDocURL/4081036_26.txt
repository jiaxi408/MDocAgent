 
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. We have closed out an audit with the Internal
Revenue Service through fiscal 2013; however, the taxing authorities will still have the ability to review the propriety of certain tax attributes created in closed years if
such tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year, such as our federal research and development credit carryovers.

Historically, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with our cash and investments. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and
marketable securities totaled $21.9 million at April 30, 2021.
In the first half of fiscal 2021, we reduced our headcount across all departments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which will result in approximately $7.6 million
of annualized cost savings, and transferred our technical support services to our Poland location in an effort to further reduce cost. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we
entered into the Termination Agreement which terminated the sublease for our former headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts, effective March 21, 2021. In connection
with the early termination of the sublease the Company will pay the sublandlord a termination payment of approximately $430 thousand against an obligation of
approximately $2.8 million. Prior to the execution of the Termination Agreement, the sublease had been scheduled to expire in February 2025. As a result of the
Termination Agreement, we expect annualized savings of approximately $600 thousand in facilities costs for each of the next four years. Additionally, in the first quarter
of fiscal 2022, we issued and sold 10,323,484 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a public offering price of $1.85 per share. The Offering resulted in
approximately $17.5 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of 6.5%, or $0.12025 per share of common stock, and offering expenses of
approximately $0.2 million.
We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash expected to be provided by future operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital
expenditure requirements and other contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months.
If our expectations are incorrect, we may need to raise additional funds to fund our operations or take advantage of unanticipated strategic opportunities in order to
strengthen our financial position. In the future, we may enter into other arrangements for potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services
or technologies, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may
not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures.
Net cash used in operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $1.8 million for the three months ended April 30, 2021. Net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of our net

non-cash gain on the write-off of our operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities in relation to the Waltham lease termination, a $0.3 million non-cash foreign
currency transaction loss, and changes in working capital, which include a $0.2 million increase in accounts receivable, a $1.4 million decrease in unbilled receivables, a
$0.2 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, and a $0.2 million increase in deferred revenue.
