ARVO STUDY
Interrelationships between Macula, Skin and Serum 
Carotenoids- Paul Bernstein,Werner Gellerman et al
ARVO May 2016 
Conclusions:
"Our results emphasize  the importance of 
measuring the  total amount of carotenoids 
in the macula region using an objective  
image based modality such as AFI w 
Spectralis rather than  subjective MPOD."
Skin  resonance Raman Spectroscopy  of skin 
carotenoids is a reasonable biomarker of  
macula  carotenoid status.  and correlates 
better than  than subjective  MPOD tests. 
The objective  hand scanner is better than the subjective  
Macuscope, QuantifEYE, and Densitometer  for  estimating 
macula pigment.
