 
Pending Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces a new methodology for accounting for credit
losses on financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities and accounts receivable. The guidance establishes a new “expected loss model” that requires
entities to estimate current expected credit losses on financial instruments by using all practical and relevant information. Any expected credit losses are to be reflected as
allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of available-for-sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We are currently
evaluating if this guidance will have a material effect to our consolidated financial statements.
