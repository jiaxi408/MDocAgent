Figure FIGREF23 gives gives an explanation from the perspective in derivative: the derivative of $\\frac{(1-p)p}{1+(1-p)p}$ with respect to $p$ approaches 0 immediately after $p$ approaches 0, which means the model attends less to examples once they are correctly classified.",

        "answer_3": "Vanilla ST baseline: The vanilla ST BIBREF9 has only a speech encoder and a decoder. It is trained from scratch on the ST-TED corpus.\n\nPre-training baselines: We conduct three pre-training baseline experiments: 1) encoder pre-training, in which the ST encoder is initialized from an ASR model; 2) decoder pre-training, in which the ST decoder is initialized from an MT model; and 3) encoder-decoder pre-training, where both the encoder and decoder are pre-trained. The ASR model has the same architecture with vanilla ST model, trained on the mixture of ST-TED and TED-LIUM2 corpus. The MT model has a text encoder and decoder with the same architecture of which in TCEN. It is first trained on WMT data (out-of-domain) and then fine-tuned on in-domain data.\n\nMulti-task baselines: We also conduct three multi-task baseline experiments including one-to-many setting, many-to-one setting, and many-to-many setting. In the first two settings, we train the model with $\\alpha _{st}=0.75$ while $\\alpha _{asr}=0.25$ or $\\alpha _{mt}=0.25$. For many-to-many setting, we use $\\alpha _{st}=0.6, \\alpha _{asr}=0.2$ and $\\alpha _{mt}=0.2$.. For MT task, we use only in-domain data.\n\nMany-to-many+pre-training: We train a many-to-many multi-task model where the encoders and decoders are derived from pre-trained ASR and MT models. "

The relation across domains is captured in two ways. One is to constrain two targets that locate near each other. The other is to use a taxi or metro to commute between two targets in HAR domains mentioned in the context., Dialogue Collection: before the formal data collection starts, we required the workers to make a small number of dialogues and gave them feedback about the dialogue quality. Then, well-trained workers were paired to converse according to the given goals. The workers were also asked to annotate both user states and system states., Dialogue Annotation: we used some rules to automatically annotate dialogue acts according to user states, system states, and dialogue histories.

        "answer": "In the MULT method, two datasets are simultaneously trained, and the weights are tuned based on the inputs which come from both datasets. The hyper-parameter $\\lambda \\in (0,1)$ is calculated based on a brute-force search or using general global search. This hyper parameter is used to calculate the final cost function which is computed from the combination of the cost function of the source dataset and the target datasets. , this paper proposes to use the most relevant samples from the source dataset to train on the target dataset. One way to find the most similar samples is finding the pair-wise distance between all samples of the development set of the target dataset and source dataset., we propose using a clustering algorithm on the development set. The clustering algorithm used ihere is a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The cosine similarity is used as a criteria to cluster each question and answer. Therefore, these clusters are representative of the development set of the target dataset and the corresponding center for each cluster is representative of all the samples on that cluster. In the next step, the distance of each center is used to calculate the cosine similarity. Finally, the samples in the source dataset which are far from these centers are ignored. In other words, the outliers do not take part in transfer learning.",

We then freeze all the weights in our model, exhaustively enumerate all the sequences in the language by their lengths, and determine the first $k$ shortest sequences whose outputs the model produces inaccurately. , experimented with 1, 2, 3, and 36 hidden units for $a^n b^n$ ; 2, 3, 4, and 36 hidden units for $a^n b^n c^n$ ; and 3, 4, 5, and 36 hidden units for $a^n b^n c^n d^n$ . , Following the traditional approach adopted by BIBREF7 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF9 and many other studies, we train our neural network as follows. At each time step, we present one input character to our model and then ask it to predict the set of next possible characters, based on the current character and the prior hidden states. Given a vocabulary $\\mathcal {V}^{(i)}$ of size $d$ , we use a one-hot representation to encode the input values; therefore, all the input vectors are $d$ -dimensional binary vectors. The output values are $(d+1)$ -dimensional though, since they may further contain the termination symbol $\\dashv $ , in addition to the symbols in $\\mathcal {V}^{(i)}$ . The output values are not always one-hot encoded, because there can be multiple possibilities for the next character in the sequence, therefore we instead use a $k$ -hot representation to encode the output values.

Queries that are likely to be yes/no questions are heuristically identified: we found selecting queries where the first word is in a manually constructed set of indicator words and are of sufficient length, to be effective. Questions are only kept if a Wikipedia page is returned as one of the first five results, in which case the question and Wikipedia page are given to a human annotator for further processing. Annotators label question/article pairs in a three-step process. First, they decide if the question is good, meaning it is comprehensible, unambiguous, and requesting factual information. This judgment is made before the annotator sees the Wikipedia page. Next, for good questions, annotators find a passage within the document that contains enough information to answer the question. Annotators can mark questions as \u201cnot answerable\" if the Wikipedia article does not contain the requested information. Finally, annotators mark whether the question's answer is \u201cyes\" or \u201cno\"",

        "question": "How does Progressive Dynamic Hurdles work?",
        "answer": "It begins as ordinary tournament selection evolutionary architecture search with early stopping, with each child model training for a relatively small $s_0$ number of steps before being evaluated for fitness. However, after a predetermined number of child models, $m$ , have been evaluated, a hurdle, $h_0$ , is created by calculating the the mean fitness of the current population. For the next $m$ child models produced, models that achieve a fitness greater than $h_0$ after $s_0$ train steps are granted an additional $s_1$ steps of training and then are evaluated again to determine their final fitness. Once another $m$ models have been considered this way, another hurdle, $h_1$ , is constructed by calculating the mean fitness of all members of the current population that were trained for the maximum number of steps. For the next $m$ child models, training and evaluation continues in the same fashion, except models with fitness greater than $m$0 after $m$1 steps of training are granted an additional $m$2 number of train steps, before being evaluated for their final fitness. This process is repeated until a satisfactory number of maximum training steps is reached.",

Then, we use backpropagation to compute the gradients $f^{\\prime }(\\theta _{t})$ of the loss with respect to the current parameters (line 2b). Finally, we update the parameters with the learning rate $\\eta _t$ and the mean of the gradients (line 2c). We take the mean of the gradients to deal with minibatches of different sizes.
